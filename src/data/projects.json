        "details": "In a rural telecom site where diesel generators had become unreliable and costly, Pulita Nigeria stepped in to deploy a 25kVA Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) generator backed by two 500 SCUM gas skids and a high-efficiency Pressure Reducing & Metering Station (PRMS).",
        "challenges": [
            "The site had zero grid access and was experiencing over 50% downtime due to diesel supply inconsistencies.",
            "Local temperature variations were affecting fuel pressure and causing voltage drops.",
            "Space constraints meant we needed to optimize the layout of skids and the PRMS without disrupting tower infrastructure."
